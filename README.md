## 📚 My Obsession with Science Quotes is Real!
Here’s one of my favorite quotes (which I wrote myself—bear with me, it's a bit long):

> "I just kept on flying,  
> since no gravity attracted me.  
> I fell into the space and wondered,  
> if I get a heavier heart to fall,  
> or perhaps I should travel towards  
> the black hole and disappear!"

And here's a tech-related quote I love:

> "Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad." – Cory House
